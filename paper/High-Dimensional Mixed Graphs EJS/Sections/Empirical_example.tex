In this section, we present results of an analysis of real-world health data (from the UK Biobank). We are interested in investigating associations between the severity of a COVID-19 infection and a variety of potential risk factors.
This analysis is intended to illustrate the use of the proposed methods in a real-world, mixed variable type example.

\subsection{Data set and variables}

We first describe the data set used here which is a part of the UK Biobank COVID-19 resource in which UK Biobank data were linked to clinical COVID data. In order to construct an indicator of COVID-19 severity we consider subjects who were tested positive for COVID-19 at some point in 2020.  Based on that, we created an indicator variable (Covid severity) to capture whether each subject had a severe outcome within 6 weeks of infection (meaning either hospitalised, hospitalised receiving critical care or died). Around $14\%$ experienced such a severe outcome. \begin{figure}[ht]

\end{figure}
Overall the analysis includes $n=8672$ observations on $d=712$ variables (risk factors and covariates with less than 40\% missingness). Missing values were imputed using \texttt{missForest} R-package using  default settings. Variables expressing more than $20$ states were treated as continuous. The remaining data include $665$ binary variables, $25$ count variables and $8$ categorical variables. Many of the binary variables represent the status for relatively rare conditions. This means that the share of minority class of these indicators 
(i.e. the fraction of samples with the least frequent value of the variable)
can often be very small. 
To understand the effects of such rare events on the analysis, we defined 
 three data sets (named A, B, and C) with inclusion rules requiring respectively at least a $25\%, 2\%, 1\%$ share of observations falling into the minority class.

\subsection{Results}
 
We present results of a joint analysis of the variables considered, using the real data. 
However, we emphasize that the analysis is aimed at illustrating behaviour of the proposed estimators and not at fully understanding risk factors for severe COVID-19. There has been much work done on factors influencing risk of severe COVID-19 and on its treatment
\citep[see, among others,][]{williamson2020,berlin2020}
and we direct the interested reader to the references for further information.

Table \ref{tab:covid_associations} gives a summary of the estimated links (indicated as a visualization of the partial correlations) between the variables (including COVID-19 severity). Considering in particular links to COVID-19 severity, we see that \texttt{age}, \texttt{waist circ.}, \texttt{hypertension}, \texttt{heart attack} and \texttt{diabetes} are quite stable links throughout the different data sets. The effect sizes in terms of partial correlations are penalized and should be interpreted in relative terms. However, in particular \texttt{age} retains a relatively large signal which is in line with the known strong influence of age on COVID-19 severity \citep[see e.g][]{williamson2020}.

Finally, we present more detailed results of the analysis of data set A. Figure \ref{fig:corrplot_admat_A} shows the estimated adjacency matrix and Figure \ref{fig:corrplot_omega_A} depicts the estimated precision matrix $\hat{\boldsymbol\Omega}_{A}$. These results highlight the type of output, spanning different kinds of variables, that is readily available from the proposed method.
