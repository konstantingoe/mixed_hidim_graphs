Estimating high-dimensional undirected graphs from general mixed data is a challenging task. We propose an innovative approach that blends classical generalized correlation measures, specifically polychoric and polyserial correlations, with recent concepts from high-dimensional graphical modeling and copulas.

A pivotal insight guiding our approach is the recognition that polychoric and polyserial correlations can be effectively modeled through a latent Gaussian copula. Although adapting polyserial correlation to the nonparanormal case demands careful consideration, the polychoric correlation requires no adjustments. The resulting estimators exhibit favorable theoretical properties, even in high dimensions, and demonstrate robust empirical performance in our simulation study.

Our advocated framework builds on prior work extending the graphical lasso for Gaussian observations to nonparanormal models and subsequently to mixed data, as seen in the contributions of \cite{Fan17}, followed by \cite{Quan18} and \cite{Feng19}. A key distinction in our approach is the absence of the need for specifying bridge functions. Moreover, our method seamlessly handles various types of mixed data without requiring additional user effort, as exemplified in our analysis of phenotyping data from the UK Biobank.\todo{Potentially leave out}
